# Instagram-Account-Generator

**I Don't know which was the working one, main.py is web api, test.py is mobile api.**

This Generator is working but I just tried with https://sms-activate.org/ and https://5sim.net and just 4/100 tries the phone number worked.
With a real number it works fine but you have to find a phone provider which is working.

I made this just for testing last month and it worked, I don't know if it's still working. 

The code is very messy, I stopped working on it because I didn't needed it anymore but maybe someone who want to make a good working gen can use this for info or something idk.


There is also a working account inside so you see it workes/worked.
